ForgeGradle relies on pack200 for its binary patches.
The pack200 classes in Java were deprecated for removal in Java 11 and removed in Java 14, so for ForgeGradle to
continue working in Java 16, we cannot rely on the JVM to provide pack200.
Instead, we re-package OpenJDK 11's implementation (https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/tree/jdk-11%2B28) in this package.
We do not build the native unpacker, so it will always fall back to the Java one.

OpenJDK 11 is licensed under the GPLv2, so we can combine it with FG source which is licensed under LGPLv2.1, yielding
a combined jar licensed under GPLv2.
